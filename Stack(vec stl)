LIFO = Last In first Out ;

Key Restriction: You cannot access elements by index. You can only interact with the element at the top of the stack.
Common Functions: All operations (push, pop, top) are very fast, taking O(1) time.


#include <iostream>
#include stack>
using namespace std;
int main (){
stack<int> st;
st.push(1);
st.push(2);
st.push(3);
st.push(4);
cout<< " New Top element" << st.top() << endl;

cout<< "Is stack empty " << st.empty() << endl;
cout<<" size of stack " << st.size() << endl;

return 0 ;
}
