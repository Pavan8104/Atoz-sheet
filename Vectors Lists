A std::list is a sequence container similar to a vector. However, it is implemented as a doubly-linked list, which means its elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

 It includes most of the functions found in vector like size(), empty(), clear(), begin(), etc. The main additions are push_front() and pop_front().
While a vector's insert() operation at the beginning is costly (O(n)) because all other elements must be shifted, a list can do it in constant time (O(1)).

#include <iostream>
#include<lists>
using namespace std;
lists<int> ls;
ls.push_back(2);
ls.emplace_backe(2);
ls.push_front(5);

for(int 1: ls){
cout<<i<<;
}
return 0;
}
