What is STL? The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes that provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, stacks, etc.

Why use STL? It saves time and effort by providing pre-written, optimized code for common data structures and algorithms.

//Pairs arrays
* initilization and decleartion
pair<int, int> p = {1, 3};

* Accessing elements
cout << p.first << " " << p.second; // Outputs: 1 3

//Nested Pairs
pair<int, pair<int, int>> p = {1, {3, 4}};

pair<int, int> arr[] = {{1, 2}, {2, 5}, {5, 1}};
